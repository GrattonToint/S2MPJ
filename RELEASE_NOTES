Release notes for S2MPJ
-----------------------

6 X 2024    : correction of a few minor bugs,
              addition of the problem selection tool in s2mpjlib,
              handling of missing derivatives,
              addition of the cJtxv and cIJtxv evaluation actions.
              updating of the documentation to reflect these modifications.

16 X 2024   : added a warning about the github lists of test problems in the README
              correction of a bug in the Python library
            
5 XI 2024   : addition of the SPARCO*.m and NOZZLEfp.m problems
              extension of the classifiaction scheme to reflect problem's origin and variables' types
              updating of the documentation to reflect these modifications.
            
9 XI 2024   : correction to problem's lower bounds
              corrections to problem's classifications
              improved selection tool
              updating of the documentation to reflect these modifications.

11 XI 2024  : cleanup of the matlab_problems directory
              improvement in error handling in SPARCO problems

25 XI 2024  : added problem ARGLINA, CHANDHEU (which had escaped, somehow) and CHANDHEULS
              improved comments for problems WATSON and WATSONNE
              improved construction of sparse matrices, including removal of the addinA option of s2mpj.m
              updating of the documentation to reflect these modifications.
             
5 III 2025  : improved error messages when the user requests values or derivatives of undefined functions

21 VI 2025  : added error message in Julia files if the library has not been included before calling it
              and relevant corrections to the README and paper (despite the incomplete OMS version
              being oublished)

10 VII 2025 : correction in README.md for the procedure to include the S2MPJ library in Julia.

14 VII 2025 : correction of the default bounds for purely nonlinear variables
              added problems SPMSRTLS and WOODS
              corrected classifications for BLOWEYA, BLOWEYB, BLOWEYC and NELSONLS
              
22 VII 2025 : improvement to the handling of bounds on nonlinear variables

8 X 2025    : correction to ranges of inequality constraints

31 X 2025   : again a correction to infinite ranges of inequality constraints
              forcing pb.clower and pb.cupper to be column vectors (in Matlab)
              
3 II 2026   : update s2mpjlib.py to avoid converting 1-dimensional arrays to scalars,
              which is no longer accepted in Numpy 2.4.2 (thanks to Cunxin Huang)

6 II 2026   : minor modifications to the starting point in problems DITTERT, LIN,
              S365 and S365MOD to avoid dividion by zero at the starting point


6 II 2026   : added problems HS67, HS68, HS69, HS85, HS88, HS89, HS90, HS91 and HS92,
              hand_coded by Cunxin Hunag in Matlab, Python and Julia (thanks Cunxin!)
