#    Problem : PORTSNQP
#    *********
# 
#    A convex quadratic program of portfolio type
# 
#    The objective function is of the form
#       sum (i=1,n) ( x_i - ( 2 i - n ) / n )^2
#    There is a single equality constraint of the form
#       sum(i=1,n) x_i = 1
#    Finally, there are simple bounds
#          0 <= x_i   (i=1,n)
#
