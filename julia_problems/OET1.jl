#    Problem : OET1
#    *********
# 
#    A nonlinear programming formulation of a discretization of
#    a nonlinear Chebychev problem.
# 
#    The problem is
# 
#        min  max || phi(x,w) ||, for all w in the interval I.
#         x    w
# 
#    I is discretized, and the problem solved over the
#    discrete points.
# 
#    Nonlinear programming formulation
#        min   u     s.t.  u - phi >= 0, u + phi >= 0
#        x,u
# 
#    Specific problem: I = [0,2]
#    phi(x,w) = w^2 - x1 w - x2 exp(w)
