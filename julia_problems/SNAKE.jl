# 
#    Problem : SNAKE
#    *********
# 
#    This bivariate problem features a very nonconvex feasible region 
#    limited by two nearly parallel sine curves. The solution lies at 
#    the origin where these curves intersect.  The angle at which they 
#    intersect (and thus the conditioning of the constraint's Jacobian) 
#    is controlled by the positive parameter TIP.
# 
#    The problem is not convex.
# 
#    Source: 
#    a problem designed by Ph. Toint for experimenting with feasibility
#    issues in barrier approaches to nonlinear inequality constraints.
# 
#    SIF input: Ph.L. Toint, September 93.
# 
#    classification = "C-CLOR2-AN-2-2"
