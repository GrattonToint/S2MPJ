# 
#    Problem : TFI2
#    *********
# 
#    A nonlinear minmax problem, using a discretization.
#    The problem is
#        min  f(x)
#        s.t. max  g(x,t) <= 0
#            [0,1]
#    A brutal approach to semi-infinite programming is taken and the problem
#    is reexpressed as
#        min   f(x)
#        s.t.  g(x,ih) <= 0   i = 0, ..., M
#    In this problem, x has dimension 3.
