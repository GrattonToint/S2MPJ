#    Problem : BT10
#    *********
# 
#    Source: problem 10 in
#    P.T. Boggs and J.W. Tolle,
#    "A strategy for global convergence in a sequential 
#     quadratic programming algorithm",
#    SINUM 26(3), pp. 600-623, 1989.
# 
#    The problem as stated in the paper seems to contain a typo.
#    In order to make the second constraint feasible at the proposed 
#    solution, the sign of x2 in the second constraint has been set 
#    to - instead of +.
# 
#    The problem is not convex.
# 
#    SIF input: Ph. Toint, June 1993.
