fullproblist : the list of problems to test, with their arguments calibrated for testing

redim.m : takes the official SIF problems listed in fullproblist from ~/problems/sif,
          modify them to have the same arguments as those specified in fullproblist and writes the results in ./sif
          
regenerate.m : takes the modifies SIF problems from ./sif and decodes them to .m, .py and .jl problem files, writing
         them in ./matlab_problems, ./python_problems or ./julia_problems respectively. Also updates the docker.
         
update_docker.m : copies the modified SIF files and the python programs and problem files to the docker

test_julia_python.jl : performs comparative tests of the .jl and .py problem files specified in fullproblist

test_fortran_python.py : performs comparative tests of the Fortran (as obtained from pycutest) and .py problem
         files specified in fullproblist.  Must be run in the docker to access pycutest.

test_python.py: tests the .py problem files specified in fullproblist

test_matlab.m: tests the .m problem files specified in fullproblist
